# win10script
This is the Ultimate Windows 10 Script from a creation from multiple debloat scripts and gists from github. I also added Chocolatey and other tools to the script that I install on every machine.

powershell -nop -c "iex(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davide136/win10script/master/win10debloat-beast-updater.ps1')"

```
